1. How to Use:
    make
2. Input Format:
    One integer number from stdin.
3. Output Format:
    List of possible braces combinations + 
    Total number of answers for this paticular input.
    ((((()))))
    (((()())))
    (((())()))
    (((()))())
    ((()(())))
    ((()()()))
    ((()())())
    ((())(()))
    ((())()())
    (()((())))
    (()(()()))
    (()(())())
    (()()(()))
    (()()()())
             14
4. Limitations:
    The program does not carefully examine input format.
    So bad input will cause program to terminate. 

5. Special Features:
   Used Unbouneded String to emulate the behavior of stack
   and did a optimization base on the obeservation that 
   all answers are of same length.
   The optimizaiton is to keep appending ')' until answer
   string is as long as twice the length of number of nodes
   given.
