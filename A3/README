CSC254 Assignment 3: Interpreter

Goal:
    - Add AST generation functionality to extended calculator language
    - Interpte program written in extended calculator language
My Progress:
    I have finished both.
Extra credit:
    - Exception handling:
        handler for divide by zero is installed. The interpreter will
        continue to run and correctly catch divide by zero exception. 

How to use:
    - Input Format:
        Input program is a string written in calculator language. One
        example of such program is 
        let my_prog = "write (1+3)*2";;

    - Execute Program: 
        To get an AST run:
            ast_ize_P (parse ecg_parse_table my_prog)
        To interprete the program:
            interpret (ast_ize_P (parse ecg_parse_table my_prog) "";;

Known Bugs:
    Does not handle exceptions other than divide_by_zero well. For 
    instance exception like unexpected_input is not handled correctly.
