##Overall progress
###Base
1. [Done] Rewrite union, difference, and intersection operation to be O(N).
2. [Done] Rewrite oset to be generic. Test with double and string.
3. [Done] Update constructors to take explicit comparator function. Test with both case sensitive and case insensitive
4. [Done] Use linear-version when both comparators are the same.  
  
###Extra Credit
1. [Done] Pass comparator as one template argument. My preference is elaborated in extra/README.md
2. [Done] Add support for reverse iterators.
3. [Done] Add support for various other methods of the std::set class.
    - size()
    - find()
    - empty()
    - erase()
